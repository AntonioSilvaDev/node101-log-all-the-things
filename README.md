# Hey There :wave:

In this project, we had to build a logger, like *Morgan*, from scratch!  This one was really fun.  Every time the user hits the page, we log the incoming data to track for any issues or errors.  Anyone can check out the logs generated by navigating to "/logs"

To get started, open the app in VS code, or code editor of your choosing, and install the dependencies via the terminal by typing '$ npm install'. Next, in the terminal, type '$ node server/index.js' to start the app on the local node server and open the localhost:3000 in the browser of your choice.  Navigate to *localhost:3000/logs* to check out the generated logs
